<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pullulanase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Debranching Enzyme</li><li>Amylopullulanse</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pullulanase is an enzyme commonly used in the food and beverage industry. There are two main types of pullulanase: debranching enzyme and amylopullulanase. </p><p>Debranching enzyme helps break down complex carbohydrates like pullulan into smaller, more digestible molecules. This enzyme plays a vital role in producing products like maltodextrin and glucose syrups.</p><p>Amylopullulanase, on the other hand, is used to improve the texture and stability of certain food products. It breaks down starch molecules, helping create a more uniform and smooth consistency in food items like sauces, dressings, and gravies.</p></p>
