<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Home Lightings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-grid Solar</li><li>Grid-tied Solar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar home lightings market can be categorized into two types: off-grid solar and grid-tied solar. Off-grid solar refers to systems that are not connected to the main power grid and rely solely on solar energy to generate electricity. These systems are commonly used in remote areas where grid connections are not available. On the other hand, grid-tied solar systems are connected to the main power grid. They allow homeowners to generate solar power and potentially sell excess electricity back to the grid. These systems are commonly used in urban areas where grid connections are readily accessible.</p></p>
