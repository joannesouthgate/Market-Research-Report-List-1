<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semi-Automatic External Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-synchronous Defibrillator</li><li>Synchronous Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Semi-Automatic External Defibrillator (SAED) market consists of two main types: non-synchronous defibrillator and synchronous defibrillator. Non-synchronous defibrillators deliver electric shocks to the heart at any phase of the cardiac cycle, regardless of the heartbeat rhythm. On the other hand, synchronous defibrillators analyze the heart rhythm and deliver electric shocks only when necessary during specific phases of the cardiac cycle. Both types of defibrillators are used to treat life-threatening cardiac rhythms and restore normal heart function, but they differ in the timing of electric shocks based on the cardiac cycle.</p></p>
