<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retarders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric Retarders</li><li>Hydraulic Retarders</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Retarders are devices used in vehicles to slow down or control speed. Electric retarders utilize an electric motor to generate resistance, converting the vehicle's kinetic energy into heat. They are efficient and provide precise control. Hydraulic retarders, on the other hand, use the vehicle's hydraulic braking system to generate resistance, dissipating kinetic energy as heat. Although less efficient than electric retarders, hydraulic ones are known for their durability and ability to handle heavy loads. Both types contribute to vehicle safety by enhancing braking performance and reducing wear on traditional braking systems.</p></p>
