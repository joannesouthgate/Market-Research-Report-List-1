<p><strong>The IC Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wafer Tester</li><li>Packaged Device Tester</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>IC testers are specialized equipment used for testing integrated circuits (ICs) to ensure their functionality and quality. There are two main types of IC testers: wafer testers and packaged device testers. </p><p>Wafer testers are used to test ICs at the wafer level, which is the initial stage of IC production. They evaluate the electrical and functional performance of ICs before they are sliced into individual chips. This helps to identify any potential defects or reliability issues early in the manufacturing process.</p><p>Packaged device testers, on the other hand, are used to test ICs after they have been packaged into their final form. These testers ensure that the packaged ICs meet the required specifications and perform as intended. They verify the functionality, performance, and reliability of the ICs before they are deployed in electronic devices.</p><p>Both wafer testers and packaged device testers play crucial roles in the quality assurance of ICs, allowing manufacturers to identify faulty chips and ensure only reliable and high-quality ICs are used in electronic products.</p></p>
