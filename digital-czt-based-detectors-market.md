<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital CZT-Based Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-conversion Type</li><li>Photoconductive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital CZT-based detectors market is divided into two types: direct-conversion type and photoconductive type. The direct-conversion type uses CZT (Cadmium Zinc Telluride) crystals to directly convert incoming X-ray or gamma radiation into electrical signals. This type offers high detection efficiency and excellent energy resolution. On the other hand, the photoconductive type utilizes CZT crystals as a photoconductor that produces charge carriers under radiation, which are then converted into electrical signals. It provides higher sensitivity and faster response time compared to direct-conversion type detectors.</p></p>
