<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wood Chippers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Propelled Wood Chipper</li><li>PTO Wood Chipper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The market for wood chippers can be classified into two main types: self-propelled wood chipper and PTO (Power Take-Off) wood chipper. A self-propelled wood chipper is designed to be mobile and can move independently, making it suitable for large-scale commercial applications. On the other hand, a PTO wood chipper is powered by the tractor's engine through a drive shaft, making it more suitable for smaller-scale operations. Both types serve the purpose of efficiently chipping wood into smaller pieces, but they differ in terms of mobility and power source.</p></p>
