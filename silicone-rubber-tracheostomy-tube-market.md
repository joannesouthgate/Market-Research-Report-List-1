<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicone Rubber Tracheostomy Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Outer Cannulas</li><li>Inner Cannulas</li><li>Obturators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The silicone rubber tracheostomy tube market consists of three main types: outer cannulas, inner cannulas, and obturators. Outer cannulas are the main shafts of the tracheostomy tube that remain in the stoma to provide a secured airway. Inner cannulas are removable parts that fit inside the outer cannulas, allowing for easy cleaning and maintenance. Lastly, obturators are used during the initial insertion of the tracheostomy tube to facilitate easier placement before being replaced by an inner cannula. These three components are essential for the functionality and management of tracheostomy tubes.</p></p>
