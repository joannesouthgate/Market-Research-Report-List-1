<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion FPDs</li><li>Direct Conversion FPDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat panel X-ray detectors (FPDs) are used for capturing X-ray images in various medical and industrial applications. There are two types of FPDs: indirect conversion FPDs and direct conversion FPDs. Indirect conversion FPDs use a scintillator material to convert X-ray photons into visible light, which is then converted to an electrical signal using photodiodes. Direct conversion FPDs, on the other hand, use a detector material that directly converts X-ray photons into electrical signals. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages, and their choice depends on specific application requirements.</p></p>
