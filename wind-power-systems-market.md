<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Power Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid</li><li>Off-Grid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wind power systems can be categorized into two main types: on-grid and off-grid markets. On-grid systems are connected to the main power grid, allowing for the direct transfer of electricity generated from wind turbines to the grid. This electricity can then be used by consumers connected to the grid. On the other hand, off-grid systems are standalone and not connected to the main power grid. They are typically used in remote areas where there is no access to electricity from the grid, allowing for self-sufficiency in power generation.</p></p>
