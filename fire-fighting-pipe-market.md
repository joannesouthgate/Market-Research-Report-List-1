<p><strong>The Fire Fighting Pipe Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Fire Sprinkler System</li><li>Dry Fire Sprinkler System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fire fighting pipe market finds its major applications in wet fire sprinkler systems and dry fire sprinkler systems. Wet fire sprinkler systems utilize a network of pipes that are constantly filled with water under pressure, ready to distribute water immediately when a fire is detected. On the other hand, dry fire sprinkler systems are filled with pressurized air or nitrogen and only activate when a fire causes a sprinkler head to release the air pressure and allow water flow. Both systems aim to quickly and effectively suppress fires in various settings.</p></p>
