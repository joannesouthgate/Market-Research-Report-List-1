<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Hydraulic Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Acting</li><li>Single Acting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The linear hydraulic cylinder market consists of two main types: double acting and single acting cylinders. Double acting cylinders have two ports for fluid intake and release, allowing for movement in both directions. They are commonly used in applications where both pushing and pulling forces are required. On the other hand, single acting cylinders have only one port and rely on an external force, such as a spring or gravity, to return to their original position after being extended. They are commonly used in applications where one-directional force is needed.</p></p>
