<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The B-cell lymphoma 2 Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Combination Therapy</li><li>Monotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy used in the treatment of certain types of cancer, particularly B-cell lymphomas. There are two main types of BCL-2 inhibitors market: Combination Therapy and Monotherapy. Combination therapy refers to the use of BCL-2 inhibitors in combination with other drugs or treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy, to enhance the effectiveness of the overall treatment. Monotherapy, on the other hand, involves using BCL-2 inhibitors as a standalone treatment without any additional drugs, focusing solely on targeting the BCL-2 protein to induce cancer cell death.</p></p>
