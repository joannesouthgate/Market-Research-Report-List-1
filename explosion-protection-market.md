<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Protection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Explosion Venting System</li><li>Explosion Isolation System</li><li>Explosion Suppression</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The explosion protection market comprises three main types: explosion venting systems, explosion isolation systems, and explosion suppression systems. Explosion venting systems are designed to control the pressure caused by an explosion by allowing it to escape through designed ventilation areas, thereby reducing damage to the surrounding environment. Explosion isolation systems prevent the spread of an explosion by quickly shutting off the flow of flammable materials. On the other hand, explosion suppression systems detect and suppress an explosion by releasing chemical agents within milliseconds, preventing further damage or escalation.</p></p>
