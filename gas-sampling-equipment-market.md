<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Sampling Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Sensor System</li><li>Dual Sensor System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gas sampling equipment is divided into two types: single sensor systems and dual sensor systems. In a single sensor system, only one sensor is used to detect and measure gas levels. This type of system is simpler and more cost-effective for applications where only one gas needs to be monitored. On the other hand, dual sensor systems employ two sensors to simultaneously measure two different gases. This enables monitoring of more complex gas mixtures or situations where multiple gases need to be detected for safety or compliance purposes.</p></p>
