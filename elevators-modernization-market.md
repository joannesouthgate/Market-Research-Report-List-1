<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elevators Modernization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulic</li><li>Traction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The modernization market for elevators can be divided into two main types: hydraulic and traction. Hydraulic elevators use a piston and hydraulic fluid to power the elevator's movement. They are typically found in low-rise buildings due to their limited speed and capacity. On the other hand, traction elevators use ropes, a motor, and a counterweight system to operate. They are commonly installed in high-rise buildings as they offer faster speeds and higher weight capacities compared to hydraulic elevators. Both types aim to enhance the performance, safety, and efficiency of existing elevator systems.</p></p>
