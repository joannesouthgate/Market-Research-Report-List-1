<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Production Granulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Granulation</li><li>Wet Granulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Production granulators are utilized in various industries for the size reduction and shaping of materials. Dry granulation involves the compaction of dry powders to form granules, which are then compressed to produce the desired shape. This method is commonly used when the material is heat-sensitive or moisture-reactive. On the other hand, wet granulation involves the addition of a liquid binder to the powder, which is then agitated and dried to form granules. This method is often preferred for materials that do not flow easily or require controlled release formulations.</p></p>
