<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arterial Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Arterial Compression Pump</li><li>Circulation Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arterial pumps refer to medical devices used to improve blood circulation in the legs and feet. There are two main types of arterial pumps: arterial compression pumps and circulation pumps. Arterial compression pumps apply intermittent pressure to the legs, promoting blood flow and preventing blood clots. Circulation pumps, on the other hand, use electrical stimulation to enhance blood circulation in the legs. Both types aim to alleviate symptoms related to poor blood circulation, such as swelling, pain, and ulcers, ultimately improving overall vascular health.</p></p>
