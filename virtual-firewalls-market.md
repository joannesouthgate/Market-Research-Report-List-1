<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Virtual Firewalls Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bridge-mode</li><li>Hypervisor-mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Virtual firewalls are a crucial part of modern network security. Two market types are bridge-mode and hypervisor-mode firewalls. In bridge-mode, the firewall is placed between two networks, monitoring and filtering traffic passing through it. This mode allows for seamless integration with existing networks but lacks scalability. In hypervisor-mode, the firewall is implemented within the virtualization layer, providing security at a granular level for each virtual machine. This mode offers higher scalability and flexibility, as it can protect multiple virtual networks simultaneously.</p></p>
