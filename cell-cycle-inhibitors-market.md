<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cell Cycle Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CDK4 Inhibitors</li><li>CDK9 Inhibitors</li><li>CDK6 Inhibitors</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cell cycle inhibitors are a type of drugs that interfere with the division and growth of cells. CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4), CDK9, and CDK6 are specific types of cell cycle inhibitors that target different proteins involved in cell division. CDK4 inhibitors block the action of CDK4 protein, preventing cell cycle progression. CDK9 inhibitors target CDK9, a protein involved in promoting cell division. Similarly, CDK6 inhibitors interfere with CDK6 protein, which is essential for cell cycle progression. Other cell cycle inhibitors work through different mechanisms to halt cell division and growth.</p></p>
