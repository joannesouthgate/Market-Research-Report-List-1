<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTCA Coronary Drug Eluting Balloons Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DEB Balloon</li><li>Standard Balloon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PTCA coronary drug eluting balloons (DEB) market consists of two types: DEB balloon and standard balloon. DEB balloons are specifically designed to deliver drugs directly to the coronary arteries and prevent restenosis, which is the re-narrowing of the arteries after angioplasty. They are coated with a special drug that is released into the vessel wall during inflation. Standard balloons, on the other hand, do not have drug-coating capabilities and are primarily used for dilating the narrowed arteries. Both types play crucial roles in treating coronary artery diseases.</p></p>
