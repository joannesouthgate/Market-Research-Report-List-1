<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Hygrometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Channel</li><li>Dual Channel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Portable hygrometers are devices used to measure and monitor humidity levels in various environments. Single channel hygrometers have a single sensor that measures the humidity in the air. They provide accurate and reliable measurements but can only monitor one specific location at a time. On the other hand, dual channel hygrometers have two sensors, allowing them to monitor two different locations simultaneously. This can be useful in situations where it is necessary to compare humidity levels in two separate areas or to measure and analyze the effects of humidity variations in different locations.</p></p>
