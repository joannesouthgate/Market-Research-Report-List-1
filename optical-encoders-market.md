<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Encoders</li><li>Absolute Encoders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical encoders are electronic devices used to sense and track position, speed, or direction of a rotating or linear object. There are two main types of optical encoders: incremental encoders and absolute encoders. Incremental encoders provide relative position information by producing a series of pulses when the object moves. Absolute encoders, on the other hand, provide precise position information by assigning a unique binary code to each position on the object's rotation or linear path. These encoders find extensive application in industries such as robotics, aerospace, automotive, and healthcare.</p></p>
